#This code is a configuration file for Hyprland, which is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor. Let's break down what each line does:

#1. `gaps_in = 5`: Sets the inner gaps between windows to 5 pixels.

#2. `gaps_out = 20`: Sets the outer gaps (between windows and screen edges) to 20 pixels.

#3. `border_size = 2`: Sets the border size of windows to 2 pixels.

#4. `col.active_border = rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg`: Defines the color of the active window's border. 
#It creates a gradient between two colors (light blue and light green) at a 45-degree angle.

#5. `col.inactive_border = rgba(595959aa)`: Sets the color of inactive window borders to a semi-transparent gray.

#6. `layout = dwindle`: Sets the default layout algorithm to "dwindle", which is a spiral layout.

#7. `resize_on_border = true`: Enables resizing windows by dragging their borders.

#These settings are all contained within the `general` block, which applies these configurations globally to the Hyprland 
#environment. The comment at the top provides a link to the Hyprland wiki for more information on configurable variables.
